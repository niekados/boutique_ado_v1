# One thing you may have noticed is the subtotal column still isn't being
# calculated correctly on the shopping bag page.
# This is an easy fix which we'll write a custom template filter for.
# A useful trick to have in your arsenal.
# For this column, the subtotal should be the quantity times the product price.
# In a new folder called template tags.
# I'll create a file called bag_tools.py
# And I'll also create an empty file called __init__ .py
# which will ensure that this directory is treated as a Python package
# making our bag tools module available for imports and to use in templates.
# Now in the bag tools file from django i'll import template.
# And then create a function called calc_subtotal
# Which takes in a price and a quantity as parameters and simply returns their irproduct.
# Now to register this filter we need to create a variable called register.
# Which is an instance of template.library
# And then use the register filter decorator to register our function as a template filter.
# All of this is straight from the django documentation by the way
# so if you'd like a deeper explanation of how it works
# just go there and look up creating custom template tags and filters.
# With the filter finished all we need to do to use it is load it in the bag template with load bag tools.
# Then we can pipe the price into it as the first argument.
# And send the item quantity as the second.
# To make the filter available we'll need to restart the server but doing so followed by a quick refresh
